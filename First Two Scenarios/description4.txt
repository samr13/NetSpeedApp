Describe client and AP radio specifications, and shortly comment on results from testing.

Client - Ubuntu 
AP - Xfinity (dual band 802.11ac)

Comments:
Iperf is used to calculate network throughput by pumping traffic between client and server. 
Throughput is little less than bandwidth because of latency, processing speed, jitter
For dual band, average througput is 80Mb/s when connected to 5GHZ and 40Mb/s when connected to 2.4 GHz
Some bytes of packets(tcp/udp) are send in periodic interval (for eg:10secs) from client to server and average is calculated which is the throughput/bandwidth of the network
